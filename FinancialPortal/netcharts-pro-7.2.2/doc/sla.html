					<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>1. LICENSE GRANT</strong></P> 
					               
					<small>
					<p align="justify">Subject to payment of the applicable fees, and your compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Visual Mining grants and Licensee accepts, during the term of this Agreement, a non-exclusive, nontransferable and fully paid up license to use the Software (in machine-readable, object-code form only) and its related documentation, the type of license granted as defined in Section 2 below.  Licensee may make copies of the Software for back-up purposes only, provided that Licensee reproduces the Visual Mining copyright and other proprietary rights notices on all such copies.  This license does not include any rights to disclose, license, or otherwise transfer the Software, related documentation, or other proprietary information of Visual Mining.</p>

					<p align="justify">Licensee shall keep complete and accurate records relating to its use of the Product in accordance with standard business practices in the computer industry.  Licensee grants to Visual Mining or its independent accountants, at Visual Mining's sole cost, the right to examine its books, records and accounts during Licensee's normal business hours upon at least ten (10) days advance written notice at mutually agreeable times, no more frequently than once annually, to verify compliance with the provisions of this Agreement.  Visual Mining or its independent accountants shall, at Licensee's request, agree in writing to maintain in confidence any proprietary information obtained during the course of such audit.  In the event such audit discloses that the permitted number of Processing Units or number of licensed Named Individual End Users, both as described in Section 2 below, is exceeded, Licensee shall promptly pay Visual Mining the appropriate license fee for the additional Processing Units or Named Individual End Users plus interest equivalent to ten percent (10%) per annum and shall promptly reimburse Visual Mining for all expenses associated with such examination within thirty (30) days notice by Visual Mining.  At Visual Mining's option, Visual Mining may terminate this license for failure to pay the required license fees.</p>
					</small>

					<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>2. TYPE OF LICENSE</strong></P> 

					<small>
					  <p align="justify"><B>A.	Evaluation License:</B> The Product is available for use free-of-charge only for the purpose of evaluating and testing.  Sections 6, 8 and 9A of this Agreement is not applicable to this license.  This evaluation and testing period is not to exceed thirty (30) days unless otherwise agreed to by both parties in writing.  At the end of the evaluation period, your Evaluation License will be deactivated, and Licensee must secure and pay for an End User License or Subscription License, or stop using the Product and erase or otherwise destroy all copies of the Software that are fixed or resident in the memory or hard disks of computers owned or controlled by Licensee and return to Visual Mining all other existing copies (including original copies) of part or all of the Product and related documentation. In the event Licensee chooses to discontinue using the Product, Licensee shall still be bound by the terms as set forth in Section 7, Confidential Information.  The Product is delivered "AS IS" with no support, warranty, or other obligation to Licensee.  The entire risk as to the quality and suitability of the Product is borne by Licensee.</p> 
					  <p align="justify"><B>B.	End User License:</B> An End User License is a perpetual license to use the Product solely for Licensee's internal use and operations, solely for NON-COMMERCIAL purposes, for up to the licensed number of Processing Units or Named Individual End Users which is set forth in Attachment A.  If a Processing Units based license is purchased, the Software may be installed on a network server within Licensee's internal network for the sole and exclusive purpose of permitting individual end users within Licensee's organization to access and use the Software through a network server session from another computer on Licensee's network provided that the total number of Processing Units on such network server(s) do not exceed the licensed number of Processing Units.  The number of Processing Units is calculated as the product of the number of Central Processing Units (CPUs) and the number of cores in each CPU, aggregated by total machines (e.g. if the Software is installed on two computers each having a single CPU with a quad core, the total Processing Units required is eight (8) (2 machines times 1 CPU times 4 cores)).  In virtual computing environments, the number of Processing Units is defined to be the number of processing units configured for use by the virtual machine on which the software is installed.  If a Named Individual End User based license is purchased, Licensee may install a copy of the Software on a network server within Licensee's internal network for the sole and exclusive purpose of permitting individual named end users within Licensee's organization to access and use the Software through a network server session from another computer on Licensee's network provided that the total number of individually named end users that access or use the Software on such network server(s) does not exceed the licensed number of named individual end users.  The number of licensed Named Individual End Users is calculated and aggregated by number of individually named end users that have access to or use the Software.</p>
					  <p align="justify"><B>C.	Subscription License:</B> A Subscription License is a term based license, for a period of twelve (12) months commencing on the date of license activation by Visual Mining.  Fees for a Subscription License are inclusive of the provision of services under Visual Mining’s Product Support and Enhancement Plan ("PS&E").   A Subscription License may either be a Processing Units based license, or a Named Individual End User based license.  A Subscription License shall automatically renew at Visual Mining’s then-current fees, unless Licensee provides Visual Mining with at least sixty (60) days prior written notice of its intent not to renew, prior to the expiration of the then-current term.</p>
					  <p align="justify"><B>D.	Visual Mining Order Confirmation:</B> The Visual Mining order confirmation or invoice, whichever is applicable, will specify which license is applicable to you, along with the permitted maximum number of Processing Units or permitted maximum licensed Named Individual End Users.  In the absence of any such order confirmation, receipt for payment or invoice, the "Evaluation License" is applicable to you.  If the maximum number of Processing Units or number of Named Individual End Users is not so indicated, this is a two (2) Processing Units End User License or a twenty (20) Named Individual End Users license, respectively, and such number shall not be exceeded.  This license is NOT a site, unlimited, or otherwise unrestricted license.  The End User or Subscription License will become effective only upon your issuance of a Purchase Order or payment in full of all undisputed license fees payable under Visual Mining's order confirmation or invoice.  Licensee may make only as many copies of the Product as necessary to effectuate the foregoing, provided, however, that Visual Mining grants to Licensee permission to make a reasonable number of additional copies for non-productive use of the Software for archival, backup, and disaster recovery purposes.  Licensee must contact Visual Mining and pay additional license fees if Licensee desires to change the type of license, add additional Processing Units, add additional Named Individual End Users, use the Software to process data for any other person or entity (third party), or use the Software, in whole or in part, to support Internet sites owned by any third parties. </p>
					  <p align="justify"><B>E.	License Key Activation:</B>  After purchase of an End User or Subscription License for Software, it may be necessary to activate the Software.  Activation associates the use of the Software with a specific hardware or virtual device.  During activation, the Software will create an authorization string containing information about the specific device derived from its hardware or virtual configuration that uniquely identifies your machine.  You will be asked to send this authorization string to Visual Mining to use in the creation of a unique License Key.  This is done in order to prevent unlicensed use of the Software.  BY SENDING VISUAL MINING THIS AUTHORIZATION STRING, YOU CONSENT TO THE TRANSMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION TO VISUAL MINING OR ITS RESELLER, IF APPLICABLE.  Upon Visual Mining's receipt of this authorization string, you will be issued a unique Licensee Key that will enable you to activate the Software and install it on that specific machine in accordance with the type of license purchased.  You may not re-license, reproduce or distribute any License Key associated with the Software.  If the Software that you have licensed is an upgrade or an update, then the update or upgrade may terminate your ability to use the previously licensed copy of the Software to the extent it is being replaced.  The update or upgrade and the associated License Keys, if applicable, does not constitute the granting of a second license to the Software as you may not use the upgrade or update Software in addition to the copy of the Software that it is replacing.</p>

					  <p align="justify"><B>E.	Severability.</B> If any provision of this Agreement shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this Agreement and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement.</p>
					  <p align="justify"><B>F.	Failure To Enforce.</B> The failure of either party to enforce any rights granted hereunder or to take action against the other party in the event of any breach hereunder shall not be deemed a waiver by that party as to subsequent enforcement of rights or subsequent actions in the event of future breaches. </p>
					  <p align="justify"><B>G.	Injunctive Relief.</B> It is expressly agreed that a material breach of this Agreement will cause irreparable harm to Visual Mining and that a remedy at law would be inadequate.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no failure or inability of either party to perform will be excused to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such party.</p>
					  <p align="justify"><B>M.	Entire Agreement.</B> If any portion of this Agreement is determined to be or becomes unenforceable or illegal, such portion shall be deemed eliminated and the remainder of this Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms as modified by such deletion.
